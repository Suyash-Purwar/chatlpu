# Ayra - An AI-powered Whatsapp bot to resolve academic queries of the parents of LPU students

## Introduction 
Ayra is a Whatsapp bot made for the parents of LPU students. This project aims to bring parents closer to the university by keeping them in touch with the happenings at the university and their child's academic performance. Ayra completely changes how we maintain interaction with parents by giving them a bot that knows everything about their child's performance.

Parents can ask a question in a natural language like - 'marks dikhao', 'aaj classes ki timing kya hai', 'mentor ka number do', etc, and the bot will understand their query and give them a response based on the most recent data.

## Problem Statement
Parents send their children to university with the hope that their child will become a great engineer and lead a good life ahead. They spent lakhs on their children. When they trust LPU for their child's future, as a university of international recognition, LPU should also ensure that the parents are not kept in the dark and are well informed about their child's performance.

LPU, as of now,  stays in touch with parents in the following ways:

1. UMS Parents
2. SMS Messages

Upon discussion with various parents, it was evident that these modes of communication are not effective for the majority of parents due to the following reasons:

1. Parents are often not technically sound.
2. UMS Parents portal is not easy to use.
3. UMS portal is not mobile-friendly.
4. Parents often don't remember the credentials.
5. SMS messages are often ignored.
6. Parents usually don't check SMS messages.
7. Lack of features.

## Solution

Ayra is a WhatsApp-based bot that is far more accessible than any app or website. Our parents are now much more comfortable with using Whatsapp than any other app. It is quite evident. Nowadays, in the morning, people don't read the newspaper but share Good Morning messages. It's proof that parents are comfortable and familiar with WhatsApp. Given the accessibility is high, parents are much more likely to use this bot.

Since parents are often times not well-versed in English, I have made this bot multilingual. This bot understands natural language. Parents can ask queries in Hinglish and English and receive responses in the same language.

This bot can provide parents with the following information about their ward:

1. Every Semester's Result
2. Everyday attendance
3. Overall attendace
4. Class Schedule
5. Hostel leave notification
6. UMC notification
7. HOD, Mentor, and Warden contact details
8. Teacher contact details
9. Department contact details
